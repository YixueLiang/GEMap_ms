# GEMap_ms
This repository contains code associated with the manuscript describing GEMap, which is a method capable of quantifying the differential dependence of stratified subgroups (such as KRAS-mutant cancers), therapeutic target prioritization, tissue-specific targeting, and drug candidate discovery.

# Data
GEMap consolidates CRISPR screening data from Broad Achilles 23Q2, Sanger, Avana, GeCKO and supplements these with manually curated literature-derived datasets from PubMed. Drug data were sourced from LINCS 2020 and DGIdb datasetsï¼Œincluding nearly 20,000 drug entries, enabling users to easily identify candidate drugs for genes of interest.
Processing was applied to files larger than 25 MB (CRISPR_DATA.Rdata, Mut_Data.rds, drug_data_list_20.RData, Avana_DATA.Rdata, Sanger_DATA.Rdata). These data only show a portion of the information to ensure the transparency and reproducibility.
